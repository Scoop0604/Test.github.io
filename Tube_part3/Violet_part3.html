        <h3>Relationship overview</h3>
        <p>
          In generalï¼Œwe would observe from the map that the unit house price is higher in the northwest and lower in southwest areas. 
          From some empirical studies, scholars had found a positive correlation between distance to tube station and house price. The pattern 
          of the closer to the station, the higher the house price would be observed. And the correlation is clearer if to only analysis stations with the highest passenger flows.

        <h3>HaiDianHuangZhuang Station</h3>
        <p>
          This is a station which surrounded by many famous universities and junior Schools. According to the bar chart, the unit price is much 
          higher near the station while lower in further nearby areas. And the average house price in the district is even only 1/3 of the apartment 
          near the station. A similar situation also applies to JianGuoMen Station, which is a station surrounded by many large shopping malls.

      <h3>SongJiaZhuang Station</h3>
      <p>
      This station is located in more uptown areas of Beijing. And it is one of the biggest station for daily transportation of people who
      live in near by cities. Due to the reason that it is a big transportation node. The surrounding apartments are not as high as the whole district.

      <h3>XuanWuMen Staion</h3>
      <p>
        This station is another exception. It is located in the most central area of Beijing near Tian'an men Square. In general, the whole district has a super high unit price. 
        Thus, in this situation, nearby tube stations would not be advantageous. Customers who can afford the house price also consider other factors. For example, 
        they do not need to take tube for daily transportation and there may be higher pollution near the station which is harmful for their health.
